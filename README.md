The primary objective of this project is to use machine learning models to predict flight delays. Through analyzing historical flight data alongside pertinent weather information, we seek to identify patterns and factors that contribute to flight delays. The ultimate goal is to provide airlines with actionable insights that can improve operational efficiency and enhance the overall travel experience for passengers. We leverage data cleansing, manipulation, visualization and exploration to prepare and understand our data. We then use Machine Learning techniques to predict whether a flight will be delayed or not.
